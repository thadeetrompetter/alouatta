# Who we are
We are Yenkim and Misha, a couple from the Netherlands following our dream of running a relaxed and cheap accomodation in an unspoiled and natural part of the world. 

What better place to do this than in Costa Rica?! Home to countless species of animals and plants. A whopping 2% of earth's biodiversity resides here, so it's "the" place to be if you love nature. 

#### Our vision

We want to offer you an ecofriendly, affordable and superchill environment, where you feel right at home. 

Close to nature but with all the luxury you need as a backpacker, a place where you feel at ease, can undertake activities with or without us, can feel as free as you want to feel and will be welcomed anytime. 

With both our backgrounds in restauration we are confident in giving you all you need for a good and relaxed stay on your holiday in Costa Rica.
