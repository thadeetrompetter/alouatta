# Activities in Playa Coyote

## Canoeing
At a distance of 15 minutes walking you can rent a canoe at 10 dollars per person for a whole day, to go up the mysterious, eerie mangrove to watch swamp birds or, for a rougher adventure, out to sea. We can instruct you if necessary.

## Turtle protection camp
The beach next to Playa Coyote is called "Playa Caletas" and is a protected nesting site for the Olive ridley turtle  and the (more endangered and seldomly seen) Green leatherback turtle.

A this beach there's a beautiful organisation working with volunteers to protect these magnificent animals. They will be happy to give you a night tour on the beach, seeing the turtles lay their eggs and, if you are lucky, you can even help young hatchlings with their first swim into the great Pacific ocean.

This all for a small fee of 10 dollars, which will be used for the good of the organisation.

## Butterfly farm
At 20 minutes driving our friend Mike is running his open air [Butterfly farm](link naar Mike). As an avid entomologist living in Costa rica for many years, he has a _very_ extensive knowledge about the local environment and it's animals.

He organizes 1,5 hour long tours through his open air butterfly farm at 25 dollars a person. We highly recommend doing it, you will see that there's life _everywhere_ around you, well hidden but for everyone to see if you let your eyes be guided by Mike.

## Karen Mogenson Park
A bit further away, at about 1,5 hours driving, there's a hidden gem. Undiscovered by the masses, the [Karen Mogenson](link naar site) offers beautiful hikes, encountering almost nobody while walking in an overwhelming canopy forest. The trail here leads to a beautiful waterfall and the pools on the way (and on top of the waterfall!!) give excellent chances to take a dip or two. At 1000 colones it's also the cheapest protected park in Costa rica.

## Horseriding
At the "Casa Caletas" hotel you can do horseback tours crossing the beatiful beach, guided by a local "ranchero"

## Surfing
At Playa Coyote there's a nice and gentle wave for the starting surfer. If the swell is strong enough there's a lot of fun for the intermediate surfer and if you're a pro, you can use these swells to go more out into sea, where, to the leftside of the beach, there's a reef hidden underwater. At this place and time there are excellent waves there.
If available, we rent out surfboards to our guests.

## Hiking
In the surroundings of the hostel you can make nice hikes, to the beach and further along the coast. Between Playa Coyote and Playa Caletas there lies a Peninsula which you can climb for beautiful views over the beaches.

## Bird watching
Costa rica is known for it's many birds. Around Playa Coyote (which is at the end of an estuary) there's many different species to find. Seabirds, mangrovebirds and a lot of forestbirds are to be spotted. Also colibries are to find all around you.
