We are situated along the road between SÃ¡mara and Santa Teresa, exactly between 
the village San Francisco de Coyote and Playa Coyote. With Google Maps, search for 'Hostel Alouatta, Costa Rica' and you will find us. 

###By bus
The nearest bus stop is in San Francisco de Coyote. This is the bus stop for the line that follows the coast. Also this is the stop for the bus that goes from and to San Jose. 
From San Jose the bus will take you to Jicaral (5hrs), where there's a connecting bus waiting for you to go to San Francisco de Coyote (1hr).

If necessary, we can arrange a pick up from the bus stop.
