# Our services

The first things we offer are a comfortable bed and clean facilities. 

We have a fully equipped communal kitchen at your disposal, as well as tidy bathrooms. 

Free wifi is ofcourse available and 2 days a week you can enjoy our homemade dinners for a fair price.

For the people without own motorized transport we can arrange daytrips to local sightseeing spots. We have all the information about the local activities and are always happy to help you getting around. 

Be sure to check out the ['activities'] (link to activities) part of the website for info on that.
