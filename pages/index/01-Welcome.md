Alouatta
===================

Welcome to the site of Hostel Alouatta!

## A paradise in Costa Rica

Imagine a tipi-like tent in a garden full of fruit trees. Surrounded by birds, iguanas and _alouatta's_ (howler monkeys). 
A walk down the road brings you to a beautiful, quiet beach.

We have found this paradise on earth, and we'd love to share it with you.

###Hostel Alouatta

We offer you a basic, but comfortable and unique stay in our own little jungle near the quiet, soft-sanded beach of Coyote. 
In the middle of nature, but with all the facilities you need. A place where you feel at ease, can undertake activities 
with or without us and will be welcomed anytime. 

The sleeping places we provide are furnished tents with comfortable beds. You'll have a fully equipped communal kitchen 
at your disposal, as well as tidy bathrooms. In the communal area there's books, boardgames and free Wifi available. 
If you want you can enjoy our homemade breakfast (with ingredients from our own garden) for a fair price. 

For the people without their own motorized transport we can arrange daytrips to local sightseeing spots. 
We have all the information about the local activities and are always happy to help you getting around.

Scroll down the rest of the website for an impression of our hostel and 
the many interesting activities you can find around this beautiful place.
