Alouatta
===================

Welcome to the site of Hostel Alouatta!

## A paradise in Costa Rica

Imagine a tipi-like tent in a garden full of fruit trees. Surrounded by birds, iguanas and Alouatta's (howler monkeys). 
A walk down the road brings you to a beautiful, quiet beach.

We have found this paradise on earth, and we'd love to share it with you.

Your place to be in San Fransisco de Coyote for a cheap, clean 
and comfortable stay in a green environment near the beautiful 
and quiet beach of Coyote. 

The reason we love Coyote and it's surroundings so much is because 
it's off the beaten track, undiscovered and quiet; If you hike 
around here, you truly see wild animals - not animals living in a 
small protected area which are used to people - but shy, alert and 
curious animals. 
The beach is extremely big, especially during low tide, and you can 
have it all for yourself (and some wild horses roaming around). 
The nights are still truly dark, with stars scattered bright above you. 
Paradise, right here on earth.

Scroll down the rest of the website for an impression of our hostel and 
the many interesting activities you can find around this beautiful place.
