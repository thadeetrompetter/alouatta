Alouatta
===================

Welcome to the site of Hostel Alouatta!

## A paradise in Costa Rica

Imagine a safari tent in a green garden full of fruit trees, surrounded by birds, iguanas and _alouatta's_ (howler monkeys). 
A walk down the road brings you to a beautiful, quiet beach.

We have found this paradise on earth, and we'd love to share it with you.

### Hostel Alouatta

We offer you a basic, but comfortable and unique stay in our own little jungle near the quiet, soft-sanded beach of Coyote. 
In the middle of nature, but with all the facilities you need. A place where you feel at ease, can undertake activities 
with or without us and will be welcomed anytime. 

Scroll down the rest of the website for an impression of our hostel and 
the many interesting activities you can find around this beautiful place.
