# Impression of the location

The reason we love Coyote and its surroundings so much is because 
it's off the beaten track, undiscovered and quiet. If you go for a hike you'll encounter the most colourful and exotic animals.
The beach is a 15 minute walk from the hostel and mostly you have it all for yourself (besides some wild horses roaming around). 
The nights are truly dark, with stars scattered bright above you. 
Paradise, right here on earth.

A 20 minute walk in the other direction you will find the sweet village of San Francisco de Coyote. Besides very friendly people, you will find 2 supermarkets and some restaurants here.
