# Who we are
We are Yenkim and Misha, a couple from the Netherlands. When we visited Costa Rica in the beginning of 2015, we just fell in love
with the country. With Hostel Alouatta we follow our dream of running a relaxed, ecofriendly and affordable accomodation in an unspoiled and natural part of the world.

With both our backgrounds in the hospitality industry and our own travel experiences, we know what it takes to give you a pleasant and relaxed stay on your holiday in Costa Rica. Hope to meet you soon!

###Giving back to Costa Rica
Next to offering our guests a warm welcome, we also believe we have to give something back to Costa Rica, both on a local level as well as on a bigger scale. That's why we work closely together with the local projects and activities, helping and supporting each other in different ways.

On a bigger scale, we work together with the [adopt rainforest organisation](http://www.adopteerregenwoud.nl/adopteerregenwoud.nl/en/). While keeping our prices as low as possible, we donate **_50 dollarcents per guest per night_** to this project. In this way, _you_, as one of our guests, help protecting this beautiful country.
