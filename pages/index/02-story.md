# Who we are
We are Yenkim and Misha, a couple from the Netherlands following our dream of running a relaxed and cheap accomodation in an unspoiled and natural part of the world. 

What better place to do this than in Costa Rica?! Home to countless species of animals and plants. A whopping 2% of earth's biodiversity resides here, so it's _the_ place to be if you love nature. 

#### Our vision

We want to offer you an ecofriendly, affordable and superchill environment, where you feel right at home. 

Close to nature but with all the luxury you need as a backpacker, a place where you feel at ease, can undertake activities with or without us, can feel as free as you want to feel and will be welcomed anytime. 

With both our backgrounds in the hospitality industry we are confident in giving you all you need for a good and relaxed stay on your holiday in Costa Rica.

Next to offering our guests a warm welcome, we also believe we have to give something back to Costa rica, both on a local level as well as on a bigger scale. That's why we work closely together with the local projects and activities, helping and supporting them in different ways.

On a bigger scale, we work together with [buy rainforest](link naar nl site). While keeping our prices as low as possible, we donate **_50 cents per guest_** to this project. In this way, _you_, as on of our guests, help protecting this beautiful country and providing an excellent example for the rest of the world.
