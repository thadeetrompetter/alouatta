## Directions

### By car
We are situated along the road between SÃ¡mara and Santa Teresa, exactly between
the village of San Francisco de Coyote and Playa Coyote. On Google Maps, search
for 'Hostel Alouatta, Guanacaste' and you will find us.

### By bus
The nearest bus stop is in San Francisco de Coyote. This is the bus stop for
the line that follows the coast. Also this is the stop for the bus that goes
from and to San Jose.
From San Jose ask for the bus that takes you to Jicaral (5hrs), where there's a
connecting bus waiting for you to go to San Francisco de Coyote (1hr).

If necessary, we can arrange a pick up from the bus stop in San Francisco de Coyote.
