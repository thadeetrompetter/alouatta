We have a fully equipped communal kitchen at your disposal, as well as tidy bathrooms. 

Free wifi is ofcourse available and 2 days a week you can enjoy our homemade dinners for a fair price.

For the people without own motorized transport we can arrange daytrips to local sightseeing spots. We have all the information about the local activities and are always happy to help you getting around.
