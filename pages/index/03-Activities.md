# Activities in Playa Coyote

_Canooing_:

At 15 minutes walking you can rent a canoe at 10 dollars a day per person, to go up the eerie mangrove to watch swamp birds or, for a rougher adventure, out to sea. We can instruct you if necessary.

_Turtle protection camp_:

The beach next to Playa Coyote is called "Playa Bongo" and is a protected nesting site for the [olive ridley turtle] (to some place) and (more endangered and seldom seen) [Green leatherback turtle] (to funky place). 

Here there's a beautiful organisation working with volunteers to protect these magnificent animals. They will be happy to give you a night tour on the beach, seeing the turtles lay their eggs and, if you are lucky, even release young hatchlings.

This all for a small fee of 10 dollars, which will be used for the organisation.

_Butterfly farm_:

At 20 minutes driving our friend Mike is running his open air (link naar Mike)[Butterfly farm]. As an avid entomologist living in Costa rica for .. years,  he has a _very_ extensive knowledge about the local environment and it's animals.

He organizes 1,5 hour tours through his open air butterfly farm at 25 dollars a person. We highly recommend doing it, you will see that there's life _everywhere_ around you, well hidden but for everyone to see if you let your eyes be guided by Mike.


_Horseriding_:

At the "Casa Caletas" hotel you can do horseback tours over the beatiful beach, guided by a local "ranchero"
