The nearest bus stop is in San Francisco de Coyote. This is the bus stop for the line that follows the coast. Also this is the stop for the bus that goes from and to San Jose. 
From San Jose the bus will take you to Jicaral (5hrs), where there's a connecting bus waiting for you to go to San Francisco de Coyote (1hr).
