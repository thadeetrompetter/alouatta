# Activities in Playa Coyote

_Canoeing_:

At a distance of 15 minutes walking you can rent a canoe at 10 dollars per person for a whole day, to go up the eerie mangrove to watch swamp birds or, for a rougher adventure, out to sea. We can instruct you if necessary.

_Turtle protection camp_:

The beach next to Playa Coyote is called "Playa Caletas" and is a protected nesting site for the [Olive ridley turtle] (to some place) and the (more endangered and seldomly seen) [Green leatherback turtle] (to funky place). 

A this beach there's a beautiful organisation working with volunteers to protect these magnificent animals. They will be happy to give you a night tour on the beach, seeing the turtles lay their eggs and, if you are lucky, you can even help young hatchlings with their first swim into the great Pacific ocean.

This all for a small fee of 10 dollars, which will be used for the good of the organisation.

_Butterfly farm_:

At 20 minutes driving our friend Mike is running his open air [Butterfly farm](link naar Mike). As an avid entomologist living in Costa rica for .. years,  he has a _very_ extensive knowledge about the local environment and it's animals.

He organizes 1,5 hour long tours through his open air butterfly farm at 25 dollars a person. We highly recommend doing it, you will see that there's life _everywhere_ around you, well hidden but for everyone to see if you let your eyes be guided by Mike.


_Horseriding_:

At the "Casa Caletas" hotel you can do horseback tours crossing the beatiful beach, guided by a local "ranchero"

_Surfing_:

At Playa Coyote there's a nice and gentle wave for the starting surfer. If the swell is strong enough there's a lot of fun for the intermediate surfer and if you're a pro, you can use these chances to go more into sea, where, on the leftside of the beach, there's a reef hidden underwater. At this place and time there are excellent waves there.
If available, we rent out surfboards to our guests.

_Hiking_:
In the surroundings of the hostel you can make nice hikes, to the beach and further along the coast. Between Playa Coyote and Playa Caletas there lies a Peninsula which you can climb for beautiful views over the beaches.
