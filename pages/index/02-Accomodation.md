## Communal area

In the middle of the garden there's the main building. Here you'll have a fully equipped communal kitchen 
at your disposal, as well as tidy bathrooms. There are hammocks, books, boardgames and free Wifi available. 
If you want you can enjoy our homemade breakfast (with ingredients from our own garden) for a fair price. 

## Sleeping

The sleeping quarters are fully furnished safari tents overlooking the garden, with two of them having oceanview.

We have 3 tents available, 2 private ones and 1 shared.  
The shared tent has 4 beds. The 2 private tents are equipped with double beds, suited for couples. If needed, these tents can be booked with an extra bed for a child up to 12 years. All the tents are for non-smokers and are equipped with electricity, light and ventilator. Bedsheets and towels are provided, all tents are cleaned daily.
