# Activities in Playa Coyote

Costa Rica is home to countless species of animals and plants. A Whopping 2% of earth's biodiversity resides here, so it's _the_ place to be if you love nature. Also people who look for some physical activity can go all out in Playa Coyote.

## Nature

### Turtle protection camp
The beach next to Playa Coyote is called "Playa Caletas" and is a protected nesting site for the _Olive ridley turtle_ and the (more endangered and seldomly seen) _Green leatherback turtle_.

A beautiful organisation works at this beach with volunteers to protect these magnificent animals. They will be happy to give you a night tour on the beach, seeing the turtles lay their eggs and, if you are lucky, you can even help young hatchlings with their first swim into the great Pacific ocean. This all for a small fee of 10 dollars, which will be used for the good of the organisation.

### Butterfly farm
At 20 minutes driving our friend Mike is running his open air [Butterfly farm](https://www.facebook.com/junglebutterflyfarm). As an avid entomologist living in Costa Rica for many years,  he has a very extensive knowledge about the local environment and it's animals.

He organises 1,5 hour long tours through his open air butterfly farm at 25 dollars a person. We highly recommend doing it, you will see that there's life _everywhere_ around you, well hidden but for everyone to see if you let your eyes be guided by Mike.

### Karen Mogenson Park
A bit further away, at about 1,5 hours driving, there's a hidden gem. Undiscovered by the masses, the [Karen Mogenson Park](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g7684098-d8504916-Reviews-Karen_Mogensen_Nature_Reserve-Jicaral_Province_of_Puntarenas.html) offers beautiful hikes, encountering almost nobody while walking in an overwhelming canopy forest. The trail here leads to a beautiful waterfall. The pools on the way and on top of the waterfall give excellent chances to take a dip or two. For 1000 colones (USD 2) it's also the cheapest protected park in Costa rica.

### Bird watching
Costa Rica is known for it's many and colourful birds. Around Playa Coyote (which is at the end of an estuary) there's many different species to be found. You can spot seabirds, mangrovebirds and a lot of forestbirds. And you will hear the soothing sound of hummingbirds, because they're all around.

## Sports

### Surfing
At Playa Coyote there's a nice and gentle wave for the starting surfer. If the swell is strong enough there's a lot of fun for the intermediate surfer and if you're a pro, you can use these swells to go more out into sea. Here is a well known surfer's secret called Punta Coyote. An underwater reef gives an excellent left break here. ![lifestyle upgrade](//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/alouatta/r-playa.jpg "you want it:left")

### Canoeing
At a distance of 15 minutes walking you can rent a canoe (10 dollars per person for a whole day) to go up the mysterious, eerie mangrove to watch swamp birds or, for a rougher adventure, out to sea. We can instruct you if necessary.

### Horseback riding
At the "Casa Caletas" hotel you can do horseback tours crossing the beautiful beach, guided by a local "ranchero"

### Hiking
In the surroundings of the hostel you can make nice hikes, to the beach and further along the coast. Between Playa Coyote and Playa Caletas lies a Peninsula which you can climb for beautiful views over the beaches.
