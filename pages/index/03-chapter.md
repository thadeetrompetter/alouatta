# Activities in Playa Coyote

_canooing_:

At 15 minutes walking you can rent a canoe at 15 dollars a day, to go up the eerie mangrove or for some rougher adventure, out to sea. We can instruct you if necessary.

_turtle protection camp_:

The beach next to Playa Coyote is called "Playa Bongo" and is a protected nesting site for the [olive ridley turtle] (to some place) and (more endangered and seldom seen) [Green leatherback turtle] (to funky place). 

Here there's a beautiful organisation working with volunteers to protect these magnificent animals. They will be happy to give you a night tour on the beach, seeing the turtles lay their eggs and, if you are lucky, even release young hatchlings.

This all for a small fee of 10 dollars, which will be used for the organisation.

_horseriding_:
At the "Casa Caletas" hotel you can do horseback tours over the beatiful beach, guided by a local "ranchero"
