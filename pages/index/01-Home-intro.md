===================

Welcome to the site of the Alouatta hostel! 

Your place to be in San Fransisco de Coyote for a cheap, clean and comfortable stay in a green environment near the beautiful and quiet beach of Coyote. 

The reason we love Coyote and it's surroundings so much is because it's off the beaten track, undiscovered and quiet; If you hike around here, you truly see wild animals -not animals living in a small protected area that are used to people- but shy, alert and curious animals. The beach is extremely big, especially with low tide, and you can have it all for yourself (and some wild horses roaming around), and the nights are still truly dark, with stars scattered bright above you. Paradise right here on earth.

Scroll down the rest of the website for an impression of our hostel and the many interesting activities you can find around this beautiful place.
